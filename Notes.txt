Demo.html
..........
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Demonstrate</title>
        <style>.......</style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            console.log("Hello World");

->Function:-
..............
->Function is set of statement which is used to perform specific task.

syntax:-
........
function function_Name(){
    console.log("...");
}
function_Name();//function calling

->Identifier :-
................
->Identifier are the names which are given by the developer while coding.
->Ruels:-1)Identifier should not be a keyword.
         2)Identifier shouldn't be started with special character excluding $ and _ .
         3)Identifier shouldn't be start with digit.

->Variable :-
...............
->Variable are used for store values.

->To create a variable we use 3 keyword in JavaScript.i.e let,const,var.
->Let and const are introduced in ES-6 version.
->Var is introduced in older version if JavaScript.
->Variable declaration is not possible but re-initialization is possible.
->If we declare a variable without initialization the default value will be assigned by JavaScript engine.
->The default value is undefined.
->JavaScript is a dynamic typed programming language.

->Dynamic Type Programming Language:-
......................................
->It means at the time variable declaration we no need to use datatype which means once we create a variable we can assign any time of value.
ex:-
....
let a=1;
a="JavaScript";
a=true;
a=undefined;

ex:-
...
<script>
    function main(){
        let a=10;
        console.log("Value of a is: "+a);//10
    }
    main();
</script> 

->DataType:-
..............
->Datatype are used to represent the type of value which we store into a variable.
->There are 2types 1)Primitive DataType
                   2)Non-Primitive DataType
1)Primitive DataType:-
