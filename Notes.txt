                                                            JavaScript
                                                    ..........................
->JavaScript is a High level programming language which was developed by Branden Flck in 1994 at NetScape Navigator.
->Initial name of JS is LiveScript.
->It is used to perform validation and dynamic functionalities.
->Now a days we are using for both frontend and backend purpose.
->JavaScript is Just in time(JIT) compilation programming language which means converting source code to machince code and execute immidiately.

(Q)How to create a webpage?
Demo.html
..........
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Demonstrate</title>
        <style>.......</style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            console.log("Hello World");
        </script>
    </body>
</html>    

->Function:-
..............
->Function is set of statement which is used to perform specific task.

syntax:-
........
function function_Name(){
    console.log("...");
}
function_Name();//function calling

->Identifier :-
................
->Identifier are the names which are given by the developer while coding.
->Ruels:-1)Identifier should not be a keyword.
         2)Identifier shouldn't be started with special character excluding $ and _ .
         3)Identifier shouldn't be start with digit.

->Variable :-
...............
->Variable are used for store values.
syntax:-keyword Variable_name; //Variable declaration
        Variable_name=value;   //Variable Initialization

->To create a variable we use 3 keyword in JavaScript.i.e let,const,var.
->Let and const are introduced in ES-6 version.
->Var is introduced in older version if JavaScript.
->Variable declaration is not possible but re-initialization is possible.
->If we declare a variable without initialization the default value will be assigned by JavaScript engine.
->The default value is undefined.
->JavaScript is a dynamic typed programming language.

->Dynamic Type Programming Language:-
......................................
->It means at the time variable declaration we no need to use datatype which means once we create a variable we can assign any time of value.
ex:-
....
let a=1;
a="JavaScript";
a=true;
a=undefined;

ex:-
...
<script>
    function main(){
        let a=10;
        console.log("Value of a is: "+a);//10
    }
    main();
</script> 

->DataType:-
..............
->Datatype are used to represent the type of value which we store into a variable.
->There are 2types 1)Primitive DataType
                   2)Non-Primitive DataType
1)Primitive DataType:-
........................
->This is predefined and it is 7 types i.e. Number,String,Boolean,Null,Undefined,BigInt,Symbol 
 i)Number :-
 ............>The Number datatype is used to store any numeric value, that means we can store integer or floating value.
 ex:-<script>
        function main(){
            let a=10;
            console.log(a,typeOf a);
            let b=10.5;
            console.log(b,typeOf b);
        }main();
     </script>

->log() method accepts any number of arguments.
->typeOf   is a special keyword which is used to check the datatype of a variable.
ii)String:-
............>String datatype is used to store a character or group of character.
->In JavaScript String can be represented by single or double quete or back tick '',"",``.
ex:-<script>
        function main(){
            let a="hello";
            console.log(a,typeOf a);
            let b=`world`;
            console.log(b,typeOf b);
        }main();
     </script>
     iii)Boolean:-
     ..............>Boolean type is used to store true or false values.
     ex:-<script>
        function main(){
            let gender;
            console.loog(gender,typeOf gender);
        }main();
     </script>

->If we create a variable without initialization the Initial value is undefined.
->Datatype of undefined is undefined.
->Falsy Values:-
.................>The values which are returning false when we are converting into boolean type is known as falsy values.
->Their are 6 types falsy Values i.e. false,0,null,undefined,Nan," ".
->Truth values:-
................>The values which are returning true when we are converting into boolean type is known as truth values.
->Apart from falsy values all are truth values.

iv)Null:-
............>Null is a special character or value which is represent wmpty or nothing.
->The datatype og null value is an object.
->Bug means we are not getting expected output/result.
ex:-<script>
        function main(){
            let a=null;
            console.log(a,typeOf a);
        }main();
     </script>
    
v)BigInt :-
............>BigInt datatype is used to store the large numbers which are can't be store into a number then we use BigInt.It is introduced in ES-6 version.
ex:-<script>
        function main(){
            let a=10n;
            console.log(a,typeOf a);
            let b=10.5n;
            console.log(b,typeOf b);
        }main();
     </script>  

->Operator:-
...............>Operator is used to operate in between two or more operand.
->Their are 6 types of operand present i.e Arithmatic (+,-,*,%),Relational(>,<,>=,<=,==),Logical(||,&&,=),Bitwise(|,&),Unary(++,--),conditional or teminal(?)  
->concatination:-
...................>concatination means joining or combining two or more operands.
->To perform concatination atleast one operand should be String.
->After concatination result value is String type.

->Type coercion:-
..................>Converting one tyep to another type is known as type coercion.
->ex:- 1+'1'="11" number+String=String

->NaN:-
........>NaN is a special type, which we get when the arithmatic operation is failed.
->The datatype of NaN is number.
->Type conversion:-
....................>Converting one type to another type is knowns type conversion.
ex:-
Number("10");->10
String(12);->"12"

->Difference between == & ===
..................................
->Double equal(==) is a normal comparision operator but === is not a normal comparision operator.
->== support type coercion but === not support type coercion.
->== checks the values not datatype but === checks the values and datatype also.
ex:-function main(){
    let 1=5;
    let b="5";
    if(a==b){
        console.log("Hello");
    }
    else{
        console.log("world");
    }
    if(a===b){
        console.log("Hii");
    }
    else{
        console.log("Hyy");
    }
}main();

->math.trunc() is used for remove the decimal part of a number and return only integer part.Basically we are not using business logic because it removes the decimal point.

->Looping statement:-
.....................>For iterating over the values we are using Looping concepts.
->It is 5 types i.e.(i) while Loop syntax:-initialization while(condition){//   Incr/Decr}
                    (ii)For Loop syntax:-for(initialization;updation;Incr/Decr);
                    (iii)Do-while Loop syntax:-do{//} while(condition);
                    (iv)For each Loop
                    (v)For in Loop

->break:-
..........>It is used to terminate the execution.
ex:-function main(){
    for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            break;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
}
main();

->Continue:-
.............>Continue is used for skip the execution.
ex:-function main(){
    for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            continue;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
}
main();

->return :-
............>The return statement is used to specfiy the value that a function should output or return back to the caller method.
ex:-function main(){
    for(int i=1;i<=5;i++){
        if(i%2==0){
            return;
        }
        console.log(i);
    }
    console.log("outside loop");
}
main();
